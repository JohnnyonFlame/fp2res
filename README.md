# What is contained in this repository?

This is an utility to patch Freedom Planet 2's internal resolution from 640x360 to a multiple of it, considerably lowering Moir√© Pattern Interference and other assorted pixel crawl due pixel art resizing to arbitrary, non-integer scaling factors during gameplay.

# Usage:

- [Download the tool](https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/fp2res/releases/latest/download/fp2res.exe) (or build with `cargo build`).
- Copy `fp2res.exe` into the `Freedom Planet 2` folder, alongside the `FP2.exe` file.
- (Optional) Backup the `sharedassets0.assets` file in the `FP2_Data` folder.
- Run `fp2res.exe` and input your desired scaling factor.
- Turn on `Filter` in the in-game settings.
- Have fun!

To uninstall, use Steam's `Verify integrity of game files...` or restore your `sharedassets0.assets` backup.
